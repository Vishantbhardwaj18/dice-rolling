Explanation of the Code
Importing the random Module:

The random module is used to generate a random integer between 1 and 6, simulating the rolling of a dice.
roll_dice() Function:

This function uses random.randint(1, 6) to generate a random number between 1 and 6, representing the dice roll.
dice_simulator() Function:

The main function runs the dice rolling simulator. It:
Welcomes the user.
Asks the user if they want to roll the dice.
If the user says "yes," it calls the roll_dice() function and prints the result.
If the user says "no," it exits the loop and ends the program.
If the user inputs anything other than "yes" or "no," it prints an error message and asks again.
Main Program Execution:

The dice_simulator() function is called only if the script is run directly, ensuring that the code is modular and can be imported as a module without running automatically.
How to Run the Program
Save the code in a file called dice_simulator.py.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Follow the on-screen prompts to roll the dice as many times as you like.
This simple project is a great way to practice using functions, loops, and user input in Python. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
